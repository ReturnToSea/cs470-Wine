This project is a graphical tool for analyzing wine sales data from a CSV file. It uses a Tkinter-based GUI to allow users to generate histograms based on different criteria and visualize the sales frequency of specific wines.

1. To Run the Code, first make sure you are in the data directory that contains the program files, then hit run.
    - You can also launch the application through file explorer by opening "MakeHistogram"
2. A User Interface will appear, this will allow you to select a wine and five different histogram options.
3. After you select your wine and any other specifications depending on the option you choose, hit generate graph and your histogram will be created.
    - Keep in mind that the bottom two (Promoted and Top 20 Wine) options have their own dropbox selection. This means that the top dropbox selection does not apply here.

Notes:
- Our code works by first extracting (ExtractData.py) the data from the original files, which then get written into the CsvReaderOutput.txt file.
- After that, the CsvReaderOutput.txt is used by MakeHistogram.py to create a functional user interface that generates histograms based on selection.

Key Functions:

parse_orders(file_path):
- Reads and parses the sales data from the CSV file.
- Returns a structured list of orders.

get_wine_names(file_path):
- Extracts all unique wine names from the sales data in the CSV file.
- Returns a sorted list of wine names.

plot_item_frequency_by_hour() / plot_item_frequency_by_day():
- Generates histograms for hourly or daily sales frequencies.
- Highlights top N data points in yellow.

plot_promoted_item_histograms():
- Creates three histograms for a promoted item:
- Week prior, week of, and week after the promotion.

generate_graph():
- Determines the user-selected option and generates the appropriate histogram.
